# Privacy Policy for Screen Time Reminder

**Effective date:** September 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Screen Time Reminder Developer handles information in the **Screen Time Reminder** mobile application (the "App"). The App is designed to work **entirely on your device**. I do not operate any servers for the App and I do not receive or collect personal data from you.

---

## Summary (No personal data collected)
- I **do not collect, store, or share** any personal data with me or third parties.
- The App **does not transmit** your data off your device.
- There are **no third‑party SDKs**, **no analytics**, and **no advertising** in the App.

---

## Information processed on your device
To provide its core functionality, the App stores a local log of **timestamps when the phone is unlocked**. These timestamps are saved **only on your device’s local storage** and are used solely inside the App (for example, to show usage reminders like “you have been on the phone for 2 minutes” or to display statistics/history). This information is **not linked to your identity**, and is **never sent** to me or to others.

---

## What I do **not** collect
The App does **not** collect or share:
- Names, emails, phone numbers, or account data
- Contacts, calendar, photos, files, messages, or call logs
- Precise location, health, financial, or other sensitive information
- Advertising identifiers or analytics identifiers

---

## Permissions
The App does **not** request sensitive runtime permissions such as location, contacts, microphone, or SMS. It may request the following to support core functionality:

- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+): so the App can show **local notifications** (e.g., usage reminders) that you explicitly enable. Notifications are generated **on your device** and do not involve sending data to any server.
- The system may also allow the App to **start after reboot** so it can continue on‑device logging or scheduled notifications.

You can manage or disable notifications and background behavior in your device settings at any time.

---

## Data retention and deletion (on device)
All unlock timestamps and any settings are stored **only on your device**. You can delete this data at any time by using the App’s in‑app options (if provided) or by **clearing the App’s storage** in Android Settings, or by **uninstalling** the App.

---

## Children’s privacy
This App **may be used by children**. The App does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data from any user, including children. The App’s only function related to usage reminders is to generate **local notifications** (e.g., “You’ve been on the phone for 2 minutes”). These notifications are created **on‑device**, based on locally stored timestamps, and are **not** sent to any server.

If you are a parent or guardian and have questions about on‑device data or notifications, you can disable notifications in the system settings at any time, or uninstall the App to remove all on‑device data.

Because no personal data is collected, parental consent is **not required** for this App’s operation. If the App changes to collect personal data in the future, the Privacy Policy will be updated and, where required by law, consent will be obtained.

---

## Changes to this policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When I do, I will update the **Effective date** above and make the new version available in the App and/or on the project page.
